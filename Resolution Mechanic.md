# Skill Rolls
When you Do A Thing and there's a penalty for failure, the GM names a difficulty and the player may spend any number of points from a relevant skill's pool and roll that many dice. Each die showing 4 or above is a success. If you have a relevant specialty, count successes on a 3 or above instead.

If you spend a specialty point on a skill roll, you can attempt rolls that would ordinarily be impossible, and automatically succeed on lesser rolls.

If you don't have a relevant non-exhausted skill, you may spend points two-to-one from any other set of skills. If you can't even do that, roll one die and only count success on a 6 - even with a specialty.

When a skill has no points remaining in its pool, it is 'exhausted'.
