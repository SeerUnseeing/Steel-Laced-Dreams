Specialties are the sets of skills and talents that set you apart in your field. Having any ranks at all in a specialty is a powerful thing: If you possess a Specialty and look in the right place, you automatically succeed at finding related clues when investigating. If a specialty applies to a roll, you count success on 3+ instead of 4+.

Additionally, every Specialty produces a pool of points equal to twice its rank that refills at the start of each case. These points can be spent to gain additional information or benefits when the specialty is relevant, as well as supercharging relevant rolls. 

For example:
>Eonian, a now-retired managerial AI, is searching through transit data records in hopes of determining a pattern in a series of recent bombings. Because she has the Collation specialty, she is skilled enough in sorting through data to discover the truth of the matter without needing to roll. There’s a little-traveled warehouse in the industrial district; half an hour before each bombing, somebody traveled from that warehouse to the site, though they covered their tracks well.
>
>Wanting a little more information before setting out, she spends a point from her Collation pool to compare all the transit records relating to that warehouse. What she finds is troubling - discreet shipments of explosive precursors, electronic parts, and metal casings. The bombs were built there, and it’s a lot of raw material. Her blood runs cold, and she puts in an order for a new (and tougher) body as she heads out the door.

Characters have #todo points to distribute between specialties as they see fit. A list of specialties can be found [[Lists/Specialties|here]], sorted by which general field they apply to.
