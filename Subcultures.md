There are 5 major subcultures in and around the City. 

# AD-NET %%LIMINAL MOON%%

AD-NET is a group of volunteers responsible for much of the City’s planning and overall governance. Somewhere between bureaucracy and committee, AD-NET members handle the nuts and bolts of keeping the city going - repairing the roads, designing new developments, updating regulations, issuing licenses, and so on. In theory, participants in the AD-NET have immense control over the day-to-day life of the city’s citizens, but the realities of AD-NET politics often limits the extent of possible impositions in both scale and scope.

# Highlight %%Goldenrod Jones%%

The Highlight was once the name of a popular streaming service, but has grown to encompass a whole sphere of media personalities and event spaces. From classy parties to soap operas to roaring concerts, the Highlight revolves around spectacle, subdued or otherwise. The personalities popularized by the Highlight are likely to be the most well-known among the general population - some people know the moves involved in AD-NET or Farflung politics, but everyone can name a director or celebrity.

# Self-hacker %%Rose%%

Self-hackers are artists, philosophers, and tinkers. They are their own preferred medium, shaping and reshaping their selves and senses. They often eventually become a sort of thesis - a living example of an alternative way of being. Self-hackers have a dense peer-to-peer network, congregating on message-boards and collectives. Though relatively small in number, self-hackers tend to be skilled in esoteric fields; if you come to them with a strange request, they’ll likely either know how to do it or know someone who does.

# Farflung %%T417%%

Separated by minutes of latency and days of travel, the Farflung are simultaneously the most important workers in the solar system and the most isolated. Even with its efforts at recycling and resource management, the City requires a steady inflow of resources to continue functioning. Much of this can be handled by subcognizant automated systems, but the Farflung fill the gaps where work remains - asteroid-mining technicians, interstellar shippers, and the workers on the Equinox Mesh. The Farflung live a life so different from the bustling, interconnected worlds they supply that it’s often hard to fathom: to be Farflung isn’t merely working on a long-distance freighter - it’s enduring the cold dark with only a handful of crewmates and digital worlds for company; it’s watching text blit onto your screen, your only connection to home; it’s wearing a body not your own, designed to survive the void above all else. The only people who choose to be Farflung are those willing or eager to accept those conditions; often quiet, always strange, and seldom extroverted.
